collection: publications
permalink: /publication/colm2024
excerpt: 'We presents a pioneering comprehensive survey of deep learning for theorem proving by offering i) a thorough review of existing approaches across various tasks such as autoformalization, premise selection, proofstep generation, and proof search; ii) a meticulous summary of available datasets and strategies for data generation; iii) a detailed analysis of evaluation metrics and the performance of state-of-the-art; and iv) a critical discussion on the persistent challenges and the promising avenues for future exploration.'
