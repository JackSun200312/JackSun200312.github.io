title: "Autoformalizing Euclidean Geometry"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/icml2024
excerpt: 'We release LeanEuclid, a benchmark for testing autoformalization, consisting of Euclid's Elements (Book I) manually formalized in Lean. It is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4V. Furthermore, the process of constructing LeanEuclid has uncovered intriguing ambiguities in Euclid's original works.'
